      <description>Perhe- ja peruspalveluministeri Krista Kiuru (sd.) kertoo, että vanhuspalvelulakia päivitetään kahdessa
            osassa.  Ensimmäiseksi hallitus aikoo säätää kiireellisesti sitovan vähimmäismitoituksen (0,7)
            ympärivuorokautiseen hoivaan. Mitoituksen toteutuksessa otetaan huomioon hoitoisuus eli se, miten paljon
            hoitoa vanhukset tarvitsevat.</description>

      <description>Want to freak yourself out? I’m going to show just how much of your information the likes of Facebook and Google store about you without you even realising
                it.
            Google knows where you’ve been
            Google stores your location (if you have location tracking turned on) every time you turn on your phone.
                You can see a timeline of where you’ve been from the very first day you started using Google on your phone.
            Click on this link to see your own data: google.com/maps/timeline?…

            Here is every place I have been in the last 12 months in Ireland. You can see the time of day that I was
                in the location and how long it took me to get to that location from my previous one.</description>

      <title>How an Ex-Cop Rigged McDonald’s Monopoly Game and Stole Millions</title>

      <description>On Aug. 3, 2001, a McDonald’s film crew arrived in the bustling beach town of Westerly,
                Rhode Island. They carried their cameras and a giant cashier’s check to a row of townhouses, and knocked
                on the door of Michael Hoover. The 56-year-old bachelor had called a McDonald’s hotline to say he’d won
                their
                    Monopoly competition. Since 1987, McDonald’s customers had feverishly collected Monopoly game
                pieces attached to drink cups, french fry packets, and advertising inserts in magazines. By completing
                groups of properties like Baltic and Mediterranean Avenues, players won cash or a Sega Game Gear, while
                “Instant Win” game pieces scored a free Filet-O-Fish or a Jamaican vacation. But Hoover, a casino pit
                boss who had recently filed for bankruptcy, claimed he’d won the grand prize–$1 million.</description>

      <description>Our brain profoundly alters its behavior and purpose, dimming our consciousness. For a while, we become
            almost entirely paralyzed. We canâ€™t even shiver. Our eyes, however, periodically dart about behind
            closed lids as if seeing, and the tiny muscles in our middle ear, even in silence, move as though
            hearing. We are sexually stimulated, men and women both, repeatedly. We sometimes believe we can fly. We
            approach the frontiers of death. We sleep.</description>

      <description>When I was growing up in New York City, a high point of my calendar was the annual arrival of the
            Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus — ‘the greatest show on earth.’ My parents endured the
            green-haired clowns, sequinned acrobats and festooned elephants as a kind of garish pageantry. For me,
            though, it was a spectacular interruption of humdrum reality – a world of wonder, in that trite but
            telling phrase.
            Wonder is sometimes said to be a childish emotion, one that we grow out of. But that is surely wrong. As
            adults, we might experience it when gaping at grand vistas. I was dumbstruck when I first saw a sunset
            over the Serengeti. We also experience wonder when we discover extraordinary facts. I was enthralled to
            learn that, when arranged in a line, the neurons in a human brain would stretch the 700 miles from
            London to Berlin. But why? What purpose could this wide-eyed, slack-jawed feeling serve? It’s difficult
            to determine the biological function of any affect, but whatever it evolved for (and I’ll come
            to that), wonder might be humanity’s most important emotion.</description>

      <description>With a sigh, Johnny Perez rises from his plastic chair, unfolds his lanky frame and extends
            his wingspan until the tips of his middle fingers graze the walls. “It was from here to here,” he says.
            “I know because I used to do this all the time.” Until recently, these measurements—10 feet by 6
            feet—fit his entire life.
            While there is no universally agreed-upon definition, modern solitary—also called supermax, isolated
            segregation, and “the box”—is commonly understood to involve confinement to a small cell for 22 to 24
            hours a day. Prisoners are not allowed to participate in leisure activities, have hobbies, or speak to
            others. They are often handcuffed and shackled when they leave their cells—if they ever leave. Perez
            says he eventually stopped even wanting to.</description>

      <description>I wrote a post titled 6
            Toxic Habits that Most People Think Are Normal. It became very successful. A lot of people commented
            and a lot of people shared and big grown-up websites who get paid to post smart grown-up things asked me
            if they could copy/paste it, ostensibly to make a bunch of advertising money off people acting like
            assholes in their comment sections. I said, sure, why not?

      <description>Life is complicated. And I find it fascinating that people tend to make it even more complicated by not
            thinking practically.
            One of the things that we never think about is the way we think. We waste a lot of time trying to solve
            problems that are not even problems. Have you ever considered that?
            For instance, one of the questions that I get asked often is: “I don’t know how to distribute my time.
            There are a lot of things I want to do in life. What’s the best way to do everything?”
            I think: Why do you even want to do everything? By wanting that, you’re fabricating a problem. From a
            practical point of view, you can only do a few things with your time, and that also means you can
            only do a few things in a lifetime.</description>

      <description>I had a tough time in high school. Like many other young
            adolescents, I saw myself as fundamentally flawed, and felt a searing isolation. Nothing I looked
            forward to brought any hope. I stopped getting out of bed. I cut myself. I drafted a suicide note.
            It was a terrible time that I wouldnâ€™t wish on anyone. But in a strange way, my self-destructive behavior
            may have had a benefit. I eventually dropped clues about my situation, leading to an intervention that put
            me on a better track. I was hospitalized. It scared me straight, highlighting a pathway of suffering I no
            longer wanted to indulge. I went back on medication and did what it took to stay at my school.</description>

      <description>About 20 years ago I was leading a brainstorming session in one of my MBA classes, and it was like wading
            through oatmeal. We were talking about something that many organizations struggle with: how to build a
            culture of equality in a male-dominated environment. Though it was an issue the students cared about,
            they clearly felt uninspired by the ideas they were generating. After a lot of discussion, the energy
            level in the room was approaching nil. Glancing at the clock, I resolved to at least give us a starting
            point for the next session.
            “Everyone,” I improvised, “let’s forget about finding answers for today and just come up with some new
            questions we could be asking about this problem. Let’s see how many we can write down in the time we
            have left.” The students dutifully started to throw out questions, and I scribbled them on a chalkboard,
            redirecting anybody who started to suggest an answer. To my surprise, the room was quickly energized. At
            the end of the session, people left talking excitedly about a few of the questions that had
            emerged—those that challenged basic assumptions we had been making. For instance: Were there grassroots
            efforts we could support, rather than handing down rules from the top? And: What could we learn from
            pockets within our own organization that had achieved equality, instead of automatically looking
            elsewhere for best practices? Suddenly, there was much more to discuss, because we had opened up
            unexpected pathways to potential solutions.</description>
