        <p id="lqbLDV">Eric Schmidt, who was Google’s CEO between 2001 and 2011 and served on its board <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18524495/google-alphabet-board-eric-schmidt-steps-down-18-years">until last year</a>, has reinvented himself as a technology adviser and investor in the US defense community. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/technology/eric-schmidt-pentagon-google.html"><em>The New York Times</em> has published</a> a new profile on Schmidt’s work since leaving the company where he made his name, and it’s well worth a read if you’re curious about how the ex-CEO now spends his time. </p>
        {% if paywall.show %}
        
            <p id="xqbIqe">Schmidt has long advocated the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16592338/eric-schmidt-google-ai-competition-us-china">use of technology and AI in defense work</a>, and now he’s advising the government and investing in businesses to make that happen. According to the <em>NYT,</em> he now sits on two government advisory boards that promote the use of technology at the Defense Department and has also invested his personal wealth in military tech startups. </p>
        
            <p id="lFTxg7">A key area of interest for Schmidt is using technology to reduce the monotonous work done by military personnel:</p>
        
            <p id="Dp5r62">While some of the tech solutions he’s proposed have reportedly been relatively simple — like replacing an arduous white board planning process with a software solution — in other areas, his proposals have been grander, which has conflicted with the slow-moving nature of the military.</p>
        
            <p id="rKSfp5">Some of these technologies have been controversial. Since leaving Google, Schmidt invested in Rebellion Defense, a startup that analyzes video filmed via drone. There are obvious similarities here to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086276/google-ai-military-drone-analysis-pentagon-project-maven-tensorfow">Project Maven</a>, a project that saw Google help the Pentagon develop software to automatically analyze drone footage. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17418406/google-maven-drone-imagery-ai-contract-expire">Google declined to renew</a> the contract in the face of employee protests.</p>
        
            <p id="ccrUZD">Schmidt’s involvement in advisory committees has also faced criticism over fears that there could be a conflict of interest with his ongoing links to Google parent company Alphabet. Although Schmidt has left its board, he still owns $5.3 billion in Alphabet shares and still technically draws an annual salary of $1 from the company to act as an adviser. Critics claim the ex-CEO could use his influence to push organizations toward Alphabet’s tech, but Schmidt says he follows rules on avoiding conflicts of interest. </p>
        
            <p id="Do9Oen">It’s an interesting profile that sheds light on what one of the highest-profile figures in the tech world has been up to since he departed the company where he made his name. It’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/technology/eric-schmidt-pentagon-google.html">well worth reading in its entirety</a>.</p>
