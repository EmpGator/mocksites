        <p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>elcome to the US in the age of coronavirus. Faces and fists pounded the windows of Ohio’s capitol like a <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/that-ohio-protest-photo-looked-like-a-zombie-movie-zombie-movie-directors-think-so-too/2020/04/17/b518fc48-801c-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html">zombie apocalypse</a>. In Michigan, <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol">an armed crowd stormed</a> the state house. Then, history repeated itself.</p>
        <p>Taking a page from his <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/RonBrownstein/status/1256957731723857920">Charlottesville playbook</a>, Donald Trump called the protesters “good people” and urged Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, to “make a deal” over the shutdown. The president <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1256202305680158720">tweeted</a> that Whitmer should “give a little, and put out the fire”. In other words, negotiate over the barrel of a gun. After all, <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/pklinkne/status/1257079751547801607">his base</a> was “angry”.</p>
        <p>One state over, in Illinois, an anti-shutdown protester waived a poster aimed at the state’s Jewish governor, JB Pritzker: “Arbeit macht frei, JB.” <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/auschwitz-memorial-condemns-nazi-slogan-illinois-coronavirus-rally">The words that hung over the gates of Auschwitz</a>.</p>
        <p>A Trump administration insider conveyed that it was all a “bit” reminiscent of the “late” <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://bookpage.com/reviews/25070-barry-gewen-inevitability-tragedy-biography#.Xq9D0S2ZOu4">Weimar Republic</a>. We know how that ended.</p>
        <p>Society’s guardrails crashed, the <em>volk</em> demanded its pound of flesh and democracy made the frighteningly unimaginable possible. Hell became part of the here and now.</p>
        <p {% if not paywall.show %} class="paytext" {% endif %}>Election day is six months away. The US may experience 25% unemployment and economic collapse. We stand to witness “between 100,000 and 240,00 American lives lost”, <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/03/birxs-fox-news-sunday-interview-lays-bare-discord-trumps-coronavirus-response/">according to Dr Deborah Birx</a>. As for the protesters, Birx labelled their conduct “devastatingly worrisome”.</p>

            <p>“<a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-prediction-laurie-garrett.html?smid=tw-share">Collective rage</a>” looms large.</p>
        
            <p>Life and death are on the line and the president and his minions appear reluctant to grasp the reality. Echoing his boss, Larry Kudlow <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/larry-kudlow-unravels-after-cnn-airs-video-of-him-saying-in-february-that-the-coronavirus-was-contained-2020-05-03">ties himself into knots</a> over earlier pronouncements that the scourge would be quickly gone. Marc Short, Mike Pence’s chief of staff, <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/34-days-of-pandemic-inside-trumps-desperate-attempts-to-reopen-america/2020/05/02/e99911f4-8b54-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html">prematurely rejects projections</a> of a death toll above 60,000. By Tuesday, the total will probably exceed 70,000.</p>
        
            <p>How this plays out at the ballot box remains to be seen. But the early numbers should give Trump serious pause. It is unlikely that racial minorities, <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/RonBrownstein/status/1256456110808035329">suburban mothers</a> and college degree holders will take kindly to bully boys playing Trump surrogates.</p>
        
            <p>A poll taken last month showed most Americans wary of returning to normal, with those living in cities and suburbs <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/308264/americans-remain-risk-averse-getting-back-normal.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">signaling particular reluctance</a>. Indeed, Republicans disfavored such a move by nearly a two-to-one margin.</p>
        
            <p>As for the presidential horserace, <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/308264/americans-remain-risk-averse-getting-back-normal.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">Trump is lagging Joe Biden</a> in most national polls and in the swing states. Among college graduates, the former vice-president <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/4qtpeqbqm8/econTabReport.pdf">holds a near 20-point lead</a>. Biden is ahead by double digits among women. Cultural resentments are two-way streets.</p>
        
            <p>All this is a continuation of trends that appeared in the 2018 midterms. Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House and Democrats captured the female vote by <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/midterms-2018/voter-analysis">nearly three-to-two</a>, suburban women by more than 20 points, and a majority of white college graduates. <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/amyewalter/status/1257001756648706050">Peloton moms</a> made a difference.</p>
        
            <p>More ominously for the president, swing states are drifting away: Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-got-some-early-trump-vs-biden-swing-state-polling/">are lining up</a> for Biden. In a break from four years ago, seniors are growing tired of Trump. Were the trend to hold, the ballgame would be over.</p>
        
            <p>Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio also appear shaky. Biden could be sitting atop an electoral college landslide.</p>
        
            <p><a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1257059232932868103/photo/1">Excluding New York state</a>, the number of coronavirus cases have moved upward and the average number of fatalities appears stuck in neutral. This is not the re-election campaign <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-trumpism-in-full-flower-20200129-dwnu6wvixfd2vhfwht7vhjlkqi-story.html">Trump envisioned in January</a>. Not surprisingly, some of his most ardent supporters in the Senate are engaging <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/706498?unlock=ST7XVZQUXYN897LB">in political social distancing</a>.</p>
        
            <p>Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, North Carolina’s Thom Tillis and Arizona’s Martha McSally tout home-state accomplishments. They are not embracing Trump. The impeachment vote feels a century ago.</p>
        
            <p>McSally appears <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/az/arizona_senate_mcsally_vs_kelly-6801.html">destined for defeat</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/nc/north_carolina_senate_tillis_vs_cunningham-6908.html">Tillis is in a dead heat</a>. Only McConnell is given a clear edge and even he is struggling.</p>
        
            <p>Coronavirus has unleashed more than death. Social fissures once buried have metastasized into jagged volcanic chasms. The past is always with us, much as we try to jettison it. Weimar was less than a century ago. Democracy is more fragile than we may care to acknowledge.</p>
