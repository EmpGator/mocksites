        <p {% if not paywall.show %} class="paytext" {% endif %}>Best Buy is discounting a bunch of Apple gear in a new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple%2Fapple-shopping-event%2Fpcmcat748301171883.c%3F" target="_blank">shopping event</a>. The retailer is dropping the price on select Apple products, including the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-32gb-space-gray%2F5985609.p%3FskuId%3D5985609" target="_blank">10.2-inch iPad</a> ($80 off), <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-homepod-space-gray%2F5902410.p%3FskuId%3D5902410%26" target="_blank">HomePod</a> ($100 off) and <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-series-5-gps-40mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band-space-gray-aluminum%2F5706673.p%3FskuId%3D5706673" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 5</a> ($100 off).</p>

            <p>The most noteworthy deal is undoubtedly the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-32gb-space-gray%2F5985609.p%3FskuId%3D5985609" target="_blank">10.2-inch iPad</a>, which is currently on sale for $250. That’s an $80 savings off of its normal list price of $330. This iPad occasionally goes on sale at third-party retailers, and we’ve seen it drop to $330 -- even $280. But this is the best deal we’ve seen in a while.</p>
        
            <p>When we reviewed the 10.2-inch iPad last fall, we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-09-apple-ipad-review-10-2-inch-2019.html">score of 86</a>. It has the features we’ve come to expect in iPads: a solid screen, great software and decent battery life. It’s not faster than the model it replaces, but it’s the best tablet you can buy for under $500, and now it’s well under that benchmark.</p>
        
            <p>Best Buy is also knocking <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-homepod-space-gray%2F5902410.p%3FskuId%3D5902410%26" target="_blank">$100 off the HomePod</a>, which you can now get for $200. It’s one of the best-sounding smart speakers available, and we gave it an overall <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-13-apple-homepod-review.html">score of 79</a>. Siri responds quickly to commands, and it has a subtle design. But you really need to be committed to the Apple ecosystem to get the most out of the device.</p>
        
            <p>The other deal that caught our attention is the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-watch-series-5-gps-40mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band-space-gray-aluminum%2F5706673.p%3FskuId%3D5706673" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 5 for $300</a> -- that’s a $100 savings. The Apple Watch is still the best smartwatch, and this latest model packs a bright screen, always-on display, compass, international emergency calling and generally fast performance. The Series 5 is great if you’re buying an Apple Watch for the first time. But it’s a relatively minor update compared to the Series 4, so it makes upgrading to a new device less appealing if you already have one.</p>
        
            <p>Even if you’re not in the market for an iPad, HomePod or Apple Watch, it’s worth checking out <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=6c4b998ebfedcc1cac1bf8b343fce1a8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple%2Fapple-shopping-event%2Fpcmcat748301171883.c%3F" target="_blank">Best Buy’s Apple event</a>. There are a few other discounts on key hardware and accessories that might pique your interest.</p>
