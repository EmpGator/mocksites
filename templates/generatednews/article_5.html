        <p>Key developments in the global <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p>
        <p>The country’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, says <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/04/uk-coronavirus-live-draft-rules-on-post-lockdown-workplaces-leaked?page=with:block-5eb03d318f0826dcf8dc2d51#block-5eb03d318f0826dcf8dc2d51">a little more than 85,000 tests took place on Sunday</a>, the second day where the headline total has fallen back below the daily testing target of 100,000.</p>
        <p>Hancock had promised the UK would be carrying out 100,000 tests a day by the end of last month. It was announced <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/ministers-accused-of-changing-covid-19-test-tally-to-hit-100000-goal">on Friday</a> that the target had been exceeded, but the number has since dropped back down.</p>
        <p><a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/04/uk-coronavirus-live-draft-rules-on-post-lockdown-workplaces-leaked?page=with:block-5eb03dae8f0826dcf8dc2d57#block-5eb03dae8f0826dcf8dc2d57">The UK death toll reaches 28,734 as 288 more people are confirmed to have died</a>. Hancock says that is the smallest daily increase since the end of March, although he acknowledges that the daily reported rise in deaths tends to be lower on Mondays than later in the week.</p>
        <p {% if not paywall.show %} class="paytext" {% endif %}>After retesting old samples from pneumonia patients, a French hospital <a class="u-underline" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/04/coronavirus-live-news-mike-pompeo-pushes-virus-lab-theory-as-brazil-passes-100000-cases?page=with:block-5eb036878f0826dcf8dc2d12#block-5eb036878f0826dcf8dc2d12">discovers that it treated a man who had Covid-19 as early as 27 December</a>; nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases.</p>

In all, 4.4 million Italians are able to return to work, and restrictions on movement are being eased.</p>

In its first report of the impact on Italy’s mortality rate, covering 86% of the population, it says that deaths were up 39% compared with the average of the previous five years.</p>

The blow to the economy dealt by the virus – and the lockdown brought in to combat it – means 571,477 people are out of work, Austria’s AMS employment service says.</p>
