        <h1>7 Reasons You Should Eat Oatmeal Every Day</h1>
        <p>Have you ever had what I call a <em>Ratatouille</em> moment? You may have had one without realizing it,
            so let me explain what it is.</p>
        <p>In the&nbsp;Pixar&nbsp;film about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef<em>,&nbsp;</em>a food critic sits
            down at a restaurant table and tastes a dish of ratatouille, a combination of&nbsp;<a

                    href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/recipes/healthified-carrot-and-zucchini-bars-/">zucchini</a>,&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/better-type-2-diabetes-control/roasted-tomato-and-vegetable-soup-recipe/">tomatoes</a>,&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/top-foods-high-in-vitamin-c.aspx">bell
                peppers</a>, and a blend of seasonings and spices. As soon as his fork hits his lips, he's
            immediately transported back to childhood. In his mind, he's sitting at his mother’s table, filling
            himself with this comforting dish laced with bursting flavors and, of course, love.</p>

        <p{% if not paywall.show %} class="paytext" {% endif %}>
            For me, <a
                href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/creative-oatmeal-recipes/">oatmeal</a> brings a
            <em>Ratatouille moment.</em> When I was a young child, my dad worked a very early shift. He used to wake me
            up in the wee hours of the morning and welcome me to the table with a steamy bowl of oatmeal. I never knew
            or cared about what time it was, I only knew that it was dark outside and that I was going to be surrounded
            by a dish of warmth. To this day, when I’m stressed or I’m just in the mood for a hug from my plate, I know
            I can count on the comfort of this guilt-free food that somehow feels indulgent.

            <h2>7 Reasons Why Oatmeal Is a Breakfast With Benefits</h2>
            <p>If you’re not eating oatmeal every day, here’s why you <em>oat </em>to.</p>
            <h2>1. Oats Can Lower Cholesterol, Stabilize Blood Sugar, and Help You 'Go'</h2>
            <p>Oats contain both soluble and insoluble <a
                    href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/photogallery/fiber-rich-foods.aspx">fiber</a>. Soluble fiber
                forms&nbsp;a viscous gel that helps to lower <a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/high-cholesterol/symptoms/everything-you-always-wanted-know-about-cholesterol/">cholesterol</a>
                and <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/living-with/stabilize-blood-sugar-levels/">stabilize
                    blood glucose levels</a>. The insoluble fiber in oats helps provide a "moving" experience by
                curtailing <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/constipation/guide/">constipation</a> and improving
                intestinal health.</p><h2>2. Oats May Protect Your Heart and Your Colon</h2>
            <p>A variety of&nbsp;antioxidants known as avenanthramides&nbsp;are found exclusively in oats.
                Avenanthramides&nbsp;have&nbsp;been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-itching activity, and
                may provide additional protection against <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/heart-disease/">coronary
                    heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/colon-cancer/">colon cancer</a>, and skin
                irritation. They also&nbsp;may play a role in controlling <a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/high-blood-pressure/guide/">blood pressure</a>.</p>
            <h2>3.&nbsp;Oats Make an Easy, Balanced Breakfast</h2>
            <p>One cup of cooked oatmeal contains about 150 calories, four grams of fiber (about half soluble and half
                insoluble), and six grams of <a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/protein-how-much-you-need-benefits-sources-more/">protein</a>.
                To boost protein further, my favorite way to eat oatmeal is with a swirl of almond butter nestled
                within. This powerful combo will keep you away from that midmorning visit to the vending machine.</p>
            <h2>4.&nbsp;Oats Provide Important Vitamins and Minerals</h2>
            <p>Nutrient-rich oatmeal contains <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/thiamine-vitamin-b1">thiamine</a>,
                <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/foods-high-in-magnesium/">magnesium</a>, <a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/potassium-phosphate">phosphorus</a>, <a

                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/antioxidants-health-benefits-best-sources-side-effects-more/">manganese</a>,
                <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/selenium">selenium</a>, and <a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/hs/iron-deficiency-anemia/increase-iron-absorption/">iron</a>.
            </p><h2>5. Oats Are Gluten-Free</h2>
            <p>Oats are naturally <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/celiac-disease/guide/diet/">gluten-free</a>,
                but check with manufacturers to ensure that their products are not made using the same equipment as
                other potentially contaminating grains. (Always purchase gluten-free products from reputable companies
                and read food labels carefully.)</p><h2>6. Oats May Help You Control Your Weight</h2>
            <p>Oats can keep you feeling fuller longer, thereby helping you <a
                    href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/weight/three-calorie-counting-rules-for-weight-loss.aspx">control
                your weight</a>. Sadly, <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/carbohydrates/guide/">carbs</a> are
                often shunned and feared by those looking to drop a few pounds, but&nbsp;<a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/diet/whole-grains-help-prevent-type-2-diabetes-more-evidence-suggests/">whole
                    grains</a> can squash hunger and simultaneously provide that pleasant "ahhhh" feeling carb-lovers
                crave. As with any other food, be mindful of portion sizes.</p><h2>7. Oats Can Be Savory, Too</h2>
            <p>Although oats are usually paired with sweet foods like brown sugar and cinnamon or fruit, oats also make
                a perfect savory side dish. Oats provide a texture similar to buckwheat, and their bland taste is like a
                blank canvas for a variety of seasonings and spices. You can combine oatmeal with your favorite veggies
                or last night’s leftovers, and top with an&nbsp;<a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/eggs-health-benefits-nutrition-calories-more/">egg</a>&nbsp;or
                a sprinkle of cheese to enjoy&nbsp;<a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/pictures/things-nutritionists-eat-breakfast-every-day/">breakfast</a>&nbsp;for
                dinner.</p>
            <p>Foods that bring back comforting memories are precious and should be savored slowly. But proceed with
                caution when it comes to what I call "<em>Ratatouille</em>&nbsp;impersonators" — foods that remind you
                of a past experience but taste nothing like the original.&nbsp;For example, instant flavored oatmeal&nbsp;may
                conjure up Mom or Dad's homemade dish, but in reality, it may have more than 10 grams of <a
                        href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/diet/which-sugars-are-good-you-which-ones-avoid/">sugar</a>
                as compared with 1 gram. Make sure your oatmeal is healthful by choosing brands with little to no added
                sugar, and add your own toppings for flavor. To stay on the safe side, look for brands that list only
                oats on their ingredient list.</p>
