            “You’ll start to see a lot of stuff hit the screen, big investment,” Chief Executive Officer Reed
            Hastings said at an event in New Delhi on Friday. “We’re really trying to invest in that becoming more
            Indian in the content offering.”

                videos. The companies are offering relatively cheaper packages to lure paying subscribers in a country
                used to free YouTube offerings.

            <p>Hastings has said Netflix’s goal is to attract 100 million customers in India -- almost 25 times its
                estimated subscriber base there as of this year. The world’s second-most populous country is a priority
                for company, which is effectively blocked in China.</p>
            <p>Disney’s Hotstar, which is already the leader in India, will get a boost soon when the entertainment
                giant eventually introduces Disney+, a new streaming service it started last month in some markets.</p>
