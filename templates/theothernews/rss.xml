      <description>Consider DC, where local transportation authorities implemented this month new rules requiring e-scooter
            companies to limit the size of their fleetsâ€”despite tremendous demand and early indications that their
            availability is encouraging inner-city residents to eschew automobiles. (A survey of 4,500 scooterists
            by the Portland Bureau of Transportation found six percent of users reported selling their cars because
            of the new mobility offering and another 16 percent said they were considering it.)</description>

      <description>For me, oatmeal brings a
            Ratatouille moment. When I was a young child, my dad worked a very early shift. He used to wake me
            up in the wee hours of the morning and welcome me to the table with a steamy bowl of oatmeal. I never knew
            or cared about what time it was, I only knew that it was dark outside and that I was going to be surrounded
            by a dish of warmth. To this day, when I’m stressed or I’m just in the mood for a hug from my plate, I know
            I can count on the comfort of this guilt-free food that somehow feels indulgent.</description>

      <description>The study authors, led by astrobiologist Tetyana Milojevic from the University of Vienna, looked at a
            peculiar microbe by the name of Metallosphaera sedula, which is known for its voracious
            metal-hungry appetite. Because meteorites are filled with lots of the food that these microbes crave,
            researchers wanted to see how well the bugs adapted to a steady diet of extraterrestrial rock.</description>

      <description>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I really do love reading with my kids. In fact, it&#39;s one of my favorite things to do
            with my kids. But it&#39;s just so very hard to listen to my youngest learn how to read, without jumping in
            to read it for her. She can read the word &#34;the&#34; seven times in one book and then struggle to
            sound it out the next time she sees it. She can sound out a word like &#34;harbor&#34; and then get
            stumped at the word &#34;a&#34;. (I&#39;m not kidding!) And as much as I will myself to remain silent, I
            can&#39;t help but tense up at the insane contradictions that come with learning how to read.</description>

      <description>This kind of research is now possible due to the increasing availability of different types of brain
            scans. It&#39;s now feasible for researchers to do brain scans before and after mindfulness meditation
            sessions. And from those scans they can see exactly how and in what regions a subject&#39;s brain can
            change. If they see similar change patterns in a variety of test subjects (older, younger, male, female)
            researchers then can find a link between those changes and the practice of mindfulness.</description>

      <description>One of the benefits supporters of the plan foresee is helping low income residents get to and from work.
            Councilman Eric Bunch says, “When we’re talking about improving people’s lives who are our most
            vulnerable citizens, I don’t think there’s any question that we need to find that money. That’s not a
            ton of money and it’s money that we as a city, if we want to prioritize public transportation, it’s
            something that we can find.”</description>

      <description>The urban farms of the future are already here, in the form of the now familiar field of hydroponics. So
                does this mean that the urban agriculture revolution is just a matter of scaling up and breaking down
                the technology into a user-friendly system?  Maybe…or maybe not. A recent visit to the clean tech
                incubator New Lab in Brooklyn underscored that technology is just part of a broader issue, namely, how
                to introduce agricultural operations at scale into densely packed urban areas.</description>

      <description>The Honolulu City Council this week voted 7-2 to pass Bill 40, which bans businesses and restaurants in
            Honolulu County from serving food and beverages with plastic straws and utensils and containers made of
            polystyrene foam. The legislation will take effect in phases, with polystyrene foam being banned first in
            2021 and disposable plastic being banned in 2022.</description>

            the call to bring more transportation alternatives to New Yorkers,” said Paul Steely White, the
            director of safety policy at Bird.</description>
