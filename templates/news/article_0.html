        <h1>What to Consider Before Trading Your Health Data for Cash</h1>
        <p>After I signed up for my insurance plan, I got an email with a link to a “wellness program” that, if I traded
            some health data—such as steps from a pedometer or smartwatch exercise data—could earn me a small monthly
            payout and some gift cards. But the second I logged in, I felt paranoid about the whole thing.</p>
        <p {% if not paywall.show %} class="paytext" {% endif %}>If you work for a company with employer-sponsored health insurance, there’s a chance you’ve come across
            wellness programs such as <a href="https://unitedhealthcaremotion.com/" target="_blank">UnitedHealthcare
                Motion</a>, <a href="https://www.go365.com/" target="_blank">Humana Go365</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.attainbyaetna.com/" target="_blank">Attain by Aetna</a>, and <a
                    href="https://www.vitalitygroup.com/" target="_blank">Vitality</a> (The New York Times, Wirecutter’s
            parent company, offers Vitality to its employees). Each program works similarly, offering some type of
            discount or financial incentive in exchange for reaching goals, usually verified by requesting health data
            collected by a phone or fitness tracker. Insurance companies offer these programs to encourage people to
            begin or maintain healthy habits, like eating well and exercising, thus reducing health care costs.
            Employers offer them as a way to provide financial rewards you can use toward the cost of insurance or gift
            cards.</p>
        {% if paywall.show %}
        <p>Financial rewards and gift cards are tantalizing incentives, but you shouldn’t make the choice to trade away
            your health data without considering the potential issues first.</p>
        <h3>What laws protect my health data?</h3>
        <p>The laws surrounding health data are complex, and your wellness program may not include the data privacy you
            expect. The health information you share with insurance companies, HMOs, health care providers, or company
            health plans is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which helps
            keep your data private. But not all workplace wellness programs are covered by HIPAA. If a program or
            wearable tracking device is covered by HIPAA, your employer will never have access to the data collected,
            but if HIPAA doesn’t apply, you’re trusting those entities to not share the data with your employer,
            third-party ad agencies, or anyone else. Without HIPAA, a wellness program (or, more accurately, the
            operator or administrator behind it) may sell the health information it collects, which could put you at
            risk of having your data used against you or unlawfully in some way.</p>
        <p>Pam Dixon, executive director of the <a href="https://www.worldprivacyforum.org/" target="_blank">World
            Privacy Forum</a>, told me, “The best thing to do is take a close look at the privacy policy for that
            program. If it is a HIPAA-covered program, they’re going to have something called a <a
                    href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/notice-privacy-practices/index.html"
                    target="_blank">Notice of Privacy Practices</a>.” Look for phrases like “your rights under HIPAA,”
            “Notice of Privacy Practices,” or “NPP” in the privacy policy.</p>
        <p>“If you see the term ‘we are HIPAA-compliant,’ the basic rule of thumb is the program does not fall under
            HIPAA,” Dixon added.</p>
        <p>Yes, it’s confusing—although a program may call itself compliant, that doesn’t mean it’s regulated, she said.
            If it’s not covered by HIPAA, that opens the door for any data you provide to potentially be shared with
            third parties for advertising and marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <a
                href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/workplace-wellness/index.html"
                target="_blank">also adds this distinction</a>: If a wellness program is offered as part of a group
            health plan, your information is protected by HIPAA rules; if the wellness program is offered directly by an
            employer, the information is not protected.</p>
        <p>When I asked <a href="https://www.annaslomovic.com/" target="_blank">Anna Slomovic, PhD</a>, a data
            management and policy consultant, about this, she told me, “You have to remember when data is shared between
            organizations, what is happening is the data is copied and the copy is handed over. So one copy may be
            covered by HIPAA and the other copy may not be.” This could include data from the devices you track activity
            with, like a Fitbit, where the data is covered only by Fitbit's privacy policy—unless it gets moved over to
            a HIPAA-covered entity or someone acting on its behalf.</p>
        <h3>What are the problems with this type of data sharing?</h3>
        <p>Health data is some of the most private data you have, so it’s worth being mindful of where that information
            is shared and how it could be used. You may not have an issue sharing the number of steps you take on your
            pedometer, but consider what other data your fitness tracker might gather. Referencing a <a
                    href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-48342-9_3" target="_blank">chapter</a>
            from the 2017 book, <em>Under Observation: The Interplay Between eHealth and Surveillance</em>, Slomovic
            showed how much data wearable devices, apps, and health portals collected. Even in 2014, this info ranged
            from location history to the modes of transport wearers tend to use.</p>
        <p>As to how your health data could be used, we can all imagine the worst-case scenarios of sharing info about
            our eating, dieting, and exercising habits (or lack thereof) with insurance companies, but it’s what we
            haven’t thought of yet that’s more worrisome. “You don’t think this data means anything, and then all of a
            sudden somebody else takes the data and rearranges it, and all the sudden it’s a big deal,” Slomovic pointed
            out. We’ve already seen some surprising ways that fitness data can be repurposed, like when Nathan Ruser, a
            student at Australian National University, used data from the fitness app Strava to <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000005705502/big-data-big-problems-how-stravas-heat-map-uncovers-military-bases.html"
                    target="_blank">reveal the locations of military bases</a>.</p>
        <p>Many wellness programs ask you to complete surveys and risk assessments to earn points. These surveys may
            also ask questions you’re not comfortable answering, like whether you plan to get pregnant in the next year
            or two. There’s not much to gain from sharing this type of info, and you should avoid doing so—you don’t
            have to answer every question.</p>
        <p>If your family is covered by your health plan, it’s important to consider their privacy as well, especially
            that of your children. Make sure your children don’t fill out any health surveys that aren’t covered by
            HIPAA, and watch out for programs that overreach for their data (and your partner’s, too).</p>
        <p>Even if you trust all these companies to never share your health information, don’t forget about the
            possibility of data breaches. In a <a
                    href="https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2751916/types-information-compromised-breaches-protected-health-information"
                    target="_blank">paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine</a> (subscription required),
            researchers found that 71 percent of 1,461 reported data breaches at hospitals between October 2009 and July
            2019 included sensitive info, such as patient names, addresses, email addresses, or other personal
            identifiers. These breaches exposed millions of people to the risk of identity theft or financial fraud.</p>
        <h3>What should I do?</h3>
        <p>Wellness programs are often marketed as a way for you to earn money, but you can also view your participation
            as a cost.</p>
        <p>Still, the financial benefits are hard to ignore. Though it’s important to consider the potential issues,
            participating in a wellness program is not universally bad. Aside from considering HIPAA coverage, it’s best
            to steer clear of participating in programs that ask for more info than you’re comfortable sharing (like
            genetic test results) or that pay based on specific outcomes, like weight loss.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, Slomovic suggested considering two questions: Do you have a choice in the first place, whether
            you can afford to not be in these programs, both financially and in terms of being being seen as a team
            player? And if you can afford to choose, do you care what’s going to happen to that data?</p>
        <p>If you don’t like the potential that your data could be used in ways you don’t like, you should avoid these
            programs. If you’re still undecided, Dixon recommended using what she calls the “five analysis” to decide
            whether a program is worth it for you: “How does it impact you five days from now, five months from now, and
            five years from now?” </p>
        <p>Even if you’re comfortable assuming data security risks—and you consider yourself “healthy”—there’s always
            the possibility that your health status could change during the course of your participation in any wellness
            program.</p>
