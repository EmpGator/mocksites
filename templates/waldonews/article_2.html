        <p>Airbnb is taking more steps to crack down on parties and nuisance guests in the wake of a Halloween
            shooting at an Airbnb rental in a San Francisco suburb where five people were killed.</p>
        <p>The company said Thursday it’s banning “open invite” parties at all of its accommodations. Those are
            parties open to anyone and advertised on social media, for example.</p>
        <p>Airbnb says boutique hotels and professional event venues will be exempt from the new rule.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco-based company is also banning large parties at apartment buildings and condos.</p>
        <p {% if not paywall.show %} class="paytext" {% endif %}>“This policy does not impact parties that are authorized by hosts and convened respectfully by guests,”
                the company said in a news release. “Instead, our goal with this new policy is to address the small
                number of guests who act irresponsibly and those rare hosts whose homes become persistent neighborhood
                nuisances.”</p>
        {% if paywall.show %}

            <p>Airbnb says it’s in the process of identifying listings globally that may be violating the party house
                ban, including accommodations in Los Angeles, Miami Beach, London and Montreal. The company says it’s
                asking hosts to update their listings to comply with the ‘’open invite” ban.</p>

            <p>Airbnb is also issuing new guest behavior rules. In early 2020, guests will get a warning for one
                instance of excessive noise, unauthorized guests, unauthorized parking, unauthorized smoking or
                excessive messiness reported by a host or a neighbor. Further violations will result in account
                suspension or removal.</p>
            <p>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky announced last month that changes would be coming after <a
                    href="https://apnews.com/431135a2aea24475a6bb30b0d3579656" target="_blank">five people were
                killed</a> at a Halloween party shooting in Orinda. The owner of the Airbnb rental didn’t authorize the
                party, which had more than 100 guests.</p>
            <p>AirbnbWatch, a hotel-funded group that calls for stricter local home-sharing regulations, faulted Airbnb
                for responding only after the Orinda shooting. It also thinks the company’s efforts fall short.</p>






            <p>The group said Airbnb should limit rentals to owner-occupied or primary residences. Hosts in those homes
                are invested in their communities and are more careful about which guests they accept, it said.</p>
            <p>But Daniel Guttentag, an assistant professor in the department of hospitality and tourism management at
                the College of Charleston School of Business, said he thinks the new policies demonstrate Airbnb’s
                genuine intention to rid the platform of some of its most problematic activity. He thinks the rules
                could also help shield Airbnb from liability if a party goes awry.</p>
            <p>“The challenge for Airbnb will be enforcing these rules, though, as its immense scale can make that
                difficult,” Guttentag said. Airbnb has more than 7 million listings worldwide.</p>
            <p>Guttentag said it could also be hard for Airbnb to determine what is “too loud” and ensure that neighbors
                reporting a problem aren’t just trying to shut a rental down.</p>
            <p>The company is under pressure to gain the trust of travelers, neighbors and lawmakers as it prepares for
                its planned initial public offering next year.</p>
            <p>Airbnb also said Thursday it’s establishing a dedicated hotline for mayors and city officials who have
                questions about its policies.</p>
