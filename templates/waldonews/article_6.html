            <div>
                <h2>What is <em>The Mandalorian </em>about?</h2>
                <p><em>The Mandalorian </em>stars <em>Game of Thrones </em>alum Pedro Pascal as a bounty hunter who
                    hails from the planet Mandalor. In the tradition of his bounty hunter predecessors Jango and <a
                            href="https://time.com/5706585/mandalorian-boba-fett-difference/">Boba Fett</a>, the unnamed
                    Mandalorian is a helmeted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BofTUzhBtrZ/" target="_blank">“lone
                        gunfighter”</a> who wears the traditional armor of his homeland. But that’s pretty much where
                    the similarities end. While fan favorite Boba Fett was a clone raised by Jango who worked primarily
                    for Jabba the Hutt during the Galactic Empire’s tyrannical rule, the Mandalorian operates in the
                    chaotic outer reaches of the galaxy after the fall of the Empire.</p>

                <p><em>The Mandalorian </em>also stars Gina Carano as Rebel Shock Trooper-turned-mercenary Cara Dune,
                    Carl Weathers as bounty hunter guild leader Greef Carga, Giancarlo Esposito as former Imperial
                    governor Moff Gideon and Taika Waititi as the voice of assassin droid IG-11.</p>
                <h2>When does <em>The Mandalorian </em>take place?</h2>
                <p>Favreau has said that <em>The Mandalorian</em> is set five years after the fall of the Empire in <em>Episode
                    VI:</em> <em>Return of the Jedi </em>(1983) and 25 years before the rise of the First Order, the
                    authoritarian regime that is firmly in control of the galaxy when <em>Episode VII:</em> <em>The
                        Force Awakens </em>(2015) begins.</p>
                <p>In terms of <em>Star Wars</em> years, <em>Return of the Jedi </em>is set in 4 ABY (after the <a
                        href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin" target="_blank">Battle of Yavin</a>) and
                    <em>The Force Awakens </em>is set in 34 ABY, which means <em>The Mandalorian</em> takes place around
                    9 ABY. This is a period of time when the New Republic, the democratic government formed by the Rebel
                    Alliance following their victory over the Empire, has only a tenuous hold on the galaxy — especially
                    its lawless outskirts.</p>

                <p>According to Favreau, <em>The Mandalorian </em>will explore some of the roots of the First Order.
                    “You come in on <em>Episode VII</em>, [the First Order are] not just starting out. They’re pretty
                    far along,” he told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/04/the-mandalorian-first-order/"
                                           target="_blank"><em>EW</em></a>. “So somehow, things weren’t necessarily
                    managed as well as they could have been if [the galaxy] ended up in hot water again like that.”</p>


                <h2>How does ‘baby Yoda’ factor in?</h2>
                <p>In the closing minutes of the first episode, the Mandalorian discovers that the bounty target that
                    Werner Herzog’s unnamed character hired him to collect is a <a
                            href="https://time.com/5725123/baby-yoda-mandalorian/">baby of Yoda’s species</a>. Well, a
                    50-year-old baby. Where exactly <a href="https://time.com/5731562/baby-yoda-memes-explained/">baby
                        Yoda</a> — as fans have affectionately dubbed the big-eared, slow-aging alien — came from is
                    still a mystery, but the fact that there are other members of Yoda’s species in the galaxy far, far
                    away shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise. In the prequel movies, we were briefly introduced to
                    <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yaddle" target="_blank">Yaddle</a>, a female Yoda alien.
                    So we know Yoda wasn’t the only one of his kind.</p>

                <p>However, considering baby Yoda already has such a big target on his back, perhaps it means that he’s
                    especially Force-sensitive compared to his fellow Yoda aliens. After all, he already managed to use
                    the Force to save the Mandalorian from being killed by a space rhino.</p>
