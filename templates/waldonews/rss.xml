      <description>General Motors announced a joint venture Thursday with South Korea-based LG Chem to
            manufacture electric vehicle batteries in northeast Ohio, a significant step for the nation’s
            largest automaker in its bid to electrify its future offerings.</description>

      <description>Computer algorithms are used to make decisions in a range of settings, from courtrooms to schools to
            online shopping sites. The programs sort through huge amounts of data in search of useful patterns that
            can be applied to future decisions.</description>

      <description>“This policy does not impact parties that are authorized by hosts and convened respectfully by guests,”
                the company said in a news release. “Instead, our goal with this new policy is to address the small
                number of guests who act irresponsibly and those rare hosts whose homes become persistent neighborhood
                nuisances.”</description>

      <description>More than half the 482 hospitalized EVALI patients who provided specific product information to the CDC
            reported using products from Dank Vapes, which the CDC calls “a class of largely counterfeit
            THC-containing products of unknown origin.” An Inverse investigation found that Dank Vapes is not a
            legitimate company, but rather a label often affixed to counterfeit products produced by unknown makers.
            “They act like a cannabis company, but they actually don’t exist. They’re in the packaging industry,” a
            cannabis industry entrepreneur told Inverse.</description>

      <title>AI Can Now Make Medical Predictions From Raw Data. But Can Deep Learning Be Trusted?</title>

      <description>But deep learning tools also raise worrying questions because they solve problems in ways that humans
                can’t always follow. If the connection between the data you feed into the model and the output it
                delivers is inscrutable — hidden inside a so-called black box — how can it be trusted? Among
                researchers, there’s a growing call to clarify how deep learning tools make decisions — and a debate
                over what such interpretability might demand and when it’s truly needed. The stakes are particularly
                high in medicine, where lives will be on the line.</description>

      <description>The researchers collected data from 38 studies conducted in North America, Europe and Australia,
                comprising about 400,000 people without cardiovascular disease, a third of whom were younger than 45. At
                the start of each study, participants’ cholesterol levels were measured, and they answered questions
                about their medical histories, lifestyle and demographics. During a follow-up period of up to 43 years,
                almost 55,000 of the study participants developed heart disease or stroke.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the convoluted
                    order in which the Star
                    Wars movies have been released over the past 40-plus years, the timeline of events in the
                    galaxy far, far away can be
                    somewhat confusing. So with the launch of The
                        Mandalorian, Disneyâ€™s new Star Wars TV series now available on the Disney+ streaming service,
                    TIME is here to break down exactly how the show fits into the larger Star Wars timeline.</description>

      <description>Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, developed a new method of counting plastic. It
                shows more traditional methods may be missing some of the smaller microplastics, with the effect of
                underestimating the degree to which plastic is contaminating the world&#39;s oceans.</description>

      <description>Existing carbon markets have a checkered past, and unless tighter rules are put in place
                moving forward, new carbon markets could actually make the climate crisis worse. That’s because, with a
                poorly designed system, there’s the risk that carbon credits could offer polluters an opportunity to get
                out of actually having to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

      <description>Currently, the CBECI says the global Bitcoin network is
            consuming more than seven gigwatts of
            electricity. Over the course of a year that’s equal to around 64 TWh or terawatt hours of energy
            consumption. That’s more than the country of Switzerland uses over the same time period (58 TWh per
            year), but less than Colombia (68 TWh per year).</description>
